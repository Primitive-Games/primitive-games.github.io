<h1 id="our-story" style="text-align:center">Our Story</h1>
<p class="indent"> Primitive Games was founded in May of 2024 when a group of college students got together with the goal of making a game over the summer. After some time considering what to name our group, we quickly settled on Primitive Games, a play on primitive data types in some programming languages. Our logo, a caveman with a computer is also representative of how experienced we were going into our first project together.</p>
